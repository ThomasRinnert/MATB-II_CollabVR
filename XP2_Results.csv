Success and score would be the second items i refer to equally as it tells me how i should assign tasks to each operator.  i sometimes looks at current task and history to evenly distribute them but i don't find it crucial and i only do that when my operators are all loaded.,yes. it is something i primarily rely on because its visually easy to understand as a reference. but i think anything that is design visually dominating to me among stress/success/score i will pay attention to all three.,Yes,no,yes,"i like task queue literal, stress level success and score symbolic. so when i refer to those it doesnt cover up the entire screen which sometimes is distracting and visually exhausting. to the point sometimes i shut down and go blind on certain information i found too ""busy"".",I think its a very interesting task and system. i personally think the visual design might have influenced how i prioritize information as they are not equally distributed the same size/color/motion so certain information gets my attention. but if you wanted to emphasize certain information i think its a good design to capture my attention on stress level for sure. :P

My only concerns were framerate and the cubes. The low framerate made me a bit sick, and the cubes were a bit hard to handle - throwing them would sometimes fail and also their constant movement when there are too many of them is distracting. I'd also disable any feedback (particles+vibration) *unless* it actually hits an operator or fall into a basket (as a confirmation if you will).
Other than that, had fun playing around with it :p"
