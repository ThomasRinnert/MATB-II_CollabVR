Sometimes I would think I picked up easy tasks and they turned out to be hard ones, because it's kinda hard to know which one is actually gonna be picked up. In addition, it's hard to mistake a hard task with an easy one since the only thing that distinguishes them is the text on it; it'd be faster and less error-prone to have cubes of different colors.
Additionally, gravity would sometimes cause the cubes to fall in the wrong baskets. My ideal UI for this would be to have a pile of easy tasks on the left and a pile of hard tasks on the right.

If a worker is too stresses I will loose more time on the long term by giving him a task or a hard task.,I think the future stress is also important but more for the planning part in the sense that based on the future stress I was able to organize multiple task to assign instead of one task only based on the current stress. It did help a lot to learn how the team behave against stress and to then adapt my management.,"I think out of the 3 type of stress, the tested future stress was the one that less help me to complete the task or to make decision.
